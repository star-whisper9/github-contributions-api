# GitHub Contributions API v4

A fork of [GitHub Contributions API](https://github.com/grubersjoe/github-contributions-api).

## What I changed

I didn't make any changes to the code; it remains **as is**.

## What I added

Overall, it's only related to container.

- Dockerfile
- A workflow to build and push Docker images to ghcr.
- A public ghcr package(related to this repository) that you can use directly without building the image by yourself.
